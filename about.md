## Hi There!

One day I was working and I noticed that other people posts and blogs would
really help me on my way of learning image processing and machine learning.
Because of this I promised myself that I would try to help other people by
posting my thoughts or things that I found that worked for my projects. So
here we are!!

I'm Renan a Brazilian engineer very curious about how the mind works to process
informations and retrieve valuable data, because of this I started working with
computer vision and since then I fell in love with this area. I mainly work with
C++ and python but I really like logic, so I do sometimes try other programing
languages hehe!

I also have to note here that as I am a Brazilian that will be writing in english
I will make some english mistakes. If you happen to find any or thinks that
rewriting a phrase in another way will make more sense for others please email-me!
I will be glad to learn from you!

As the internet is a big place and with many opinions, I would like to point it
out that the content that was generated here express only my views and not my
employers or no one else.
