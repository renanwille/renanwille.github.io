            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately I'm reflecting into the fact that viewing how people work from other parts of the world in your area may help a lot your own understanding.</p>
<p>Lately I've been researching more deeply how to use yocto to build embedded systems and also learning a lot from other tools in code quality. For now the good materials that I've collected are detailed in this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://renanwille.com.br/docs/embedded-systems/yocto">Yocto</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But I've come to the realization that in this world there are so many ways to build a single system and they end up overlapping themselves. So learning the basis and how they work and how these are structured can help a lot. Also it seems to me that only a handful of tools are what make our processes easier.</p>
<p>For now AI is coming together in this way in some tools, but I still miss the easiness of using all of them. Maybe we are missing people that really understand how to guide the users to construct something like this?</p>]]></content:encoded>
