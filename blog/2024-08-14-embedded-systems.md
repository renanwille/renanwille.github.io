Lately I'm reflecting into the fact that viewing how people work from other parts of the world in your area may help a lot your own understanding.

Lately I've been researching more deeply how to use yocto to build embedded systems and also learning a lot from other tools in code quality. For now the good materials that I've collected are detailed in this article:

* [Yocto](/docs/embedded-systems/yocto)

But I've come to the realization that in this world there are so many ways to build a single system and they end up overlapping themselves. So learning the basis and how they work and how these are structured can help a lot. Also it seems to me that only a handful of tools are what make our processes easier.

For now AI is coming together in this way in some tools, but I still miss the easiness of using all of them. Maybe we are missing people that really understand how to guide the users to construct something like this?
