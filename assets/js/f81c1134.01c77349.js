For now the good materials that I\'ve collected are detailed in this article:\\n\\n* [Yocto](/docs/embedded-systems/yocto)\\n\\nBut I\'ve come to the realization that in this world there are so many ways to build a single system and they end up overlapping themselves. So learning the basis and how they work and how these are structured can help a lot. Also it seems to me that only a handful of tools are what make our processes easier.\\n\\nFor now AI is coming together in this way in some tools, but I still miss the easiness of using all of them.
