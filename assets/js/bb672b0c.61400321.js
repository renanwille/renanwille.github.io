If you see we have a big trend of people moving to the area with the standardization of tools like Tensorflow and Pytorch (Tools used to create machine learning models). If we look at the start of the ML rise, we will see that we evolved from more raw tools like Theano and Caffe, then it came Tensorflow and Pytorch first versions and now we are seeing more high level tools like Keras and FastAi. The big difference here, in my view, came from the fact that each new library was built in top of older libraries knowledge and then the API was made easier. In this way new users can create machine learning models more easily.
