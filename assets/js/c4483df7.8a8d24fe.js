Sometimes when we are executing some work that needs this process, like creating, inventing or re-structuring things and the creativity doesn\'t come we can feel demotivated. Elizabeth Gilbert has a nice view about this topic, she defends that on our past history the artists had an entity that would be responsable to help the creative process of one person. This ends up by giving the responsibility of the creativity to this entity, freeing the individual from guilt of not having it and also helping to share the acknowledgement for a "fantastic work".'}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.blockquote,{children:["\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:['People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons. The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons." Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar. The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius. Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual. They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist\'s studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work.
